- ***Allows custom naming conventions for save paths and scanned documents giving you the ability to organize scans by any criteria,***
- ***Allows unlimited save paths you can configure, rather than the default 1-4 a normal scanner would have,***
- ***Allows a scanned document to be saved to multiple locations at once,***


## Configurable options include the following:

- ***For app to work you must have settings.ini in the watch folder at "C:\watchFolder", and set the scanners default path to the watchfolder as well.***
