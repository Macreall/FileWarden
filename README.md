# FileWarden
This lightweight WIN32 Application enhances your printer's scanning capabilities. With this tool you can go far beyond the default scanner settings:
- Support for multiple custom save locations, organizing scans by date or any criteria,
- Allows scanned files to be saved to multiple locations at once (excellent for database and local congruency),
- Allows custom filenames to create structure in your directorys.


How to customize for you and your company:  
- Settings.ini is where you can load custom info.


Important notes before downloading:
- If you work for a company that scans hundreds or thousands of files, then this app is for you. Don't let your folders get cluttered because you don't have time to figure out a structure. Create the structure once and enjoy having a cleaner filesystem.
- This application is meant to run in the background on startup.
- When watchFolder is updated with a pdf, it will open a window so you can customize your filename and file save location.

- Release file is about 80 kilobytes of data
