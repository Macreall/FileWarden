# FileWarden
This lightweight WIN32 Application enhances any printer's scanning capabilities. With this tool you can go far beyond any default scanner settings:
- Allows custom naming conventions for save paths which can organize scanned files by any criteria desired,
- Allows scanned documents to be saved to multiple locations at once,
- Allows custom filenames to create structure in your directorys.
- Configurable options you set up once


How to customize for you and your company:  
- Settings.ini is where you can load custom info.


Important notes before downloading:
- For app to work you must have settings.ini in the watch folder at "C:\watchFolder", and set the scanners default path to the watchfolder as well.
- If you work for a company that scans hundreds or thousands of documents, then this app is for you. Don't let your folders get cluttered because you don't have time to figure out a structure. Create the structure once and enjoy having a cleaner file system.
- This application is meant to run in the background on startup.
- When watchFolder is updated with a pdf, it will open a window so you can customize your filename and directory names.
