# FileWarden
This is a lightweight C WIN32 application that gives you a gui to update file paths scanned from a printer.

Important notes before downloading:
- This application is meant to run in the background on startup.
- If you are working for a company where you scan hundreds or even thousands of files to specific folders and need to organize them quickly, this application is to give you quick options for renaming, moving, and organizing mass amounts of files with ease.
- When watchFolder is updated with a pdf, it will open the window to choose where you want that file to go.

How to customize for your company:  
- Settings.ini is where you can load custom info.
You can edit the settings directly in C:\watchFolder, or through the settings menu accessed through the tray icon.
