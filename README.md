- ***Allows custom naming conventions for save paths which can organize scanned files by any criteria desired,***
- ***Allows scanned documents to have unlimited default save paths, rather than the default 1-4 save paths,***
- ***Allows a scanned document to be saved to multiple locations at once,***
- ***Allows custom file naming giving complete control over structure,***
- ***Configurable options you set up once.***


## Configurable options include the following:

## Important notes before downloading:
- ***For app to work you must have settings.ini in the watch folder at "C:\watchFolder", and set the scanners default path to the watchfolder as well.***
